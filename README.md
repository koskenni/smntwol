Inari Saami morphological analysis

Copyright Â© 2018, Kimmo Koskenniemi and Marja-Liisa Olthuis

The aim is to create a morphological two-level analysator for Inari Saami (smn) using new methods whre all or most phonemic alternations are described using morphophonemes which are deduced mechanically by aligning the stems and affixes of example words.  Morphophonemes are established through this alignment.  Rules are made using the twol.py compiler available in the **twol** project. See also the documentation of the simplified two-level model at https://pytwolc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
