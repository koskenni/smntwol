Inari Saami morphological analysis

The aim is to create a morphological two-level analysator for Inari Saami (smn) using new methods whre all or most phonemic alternations are described using morphophonemes which are deduced mechanically by aligning the stems and affixes of example words.  Morphophonemes are established through this alignment.  Rules are made using the compiler available in the pytwolc project.
